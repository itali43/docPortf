# Lit Ceramic Integration

I built Lit's Integration with Ceramic and its corresponding example project and the NPM. The docs have likely changed slightly, the project is still in use / maintained, so I grabbed links to a branch that hasn't been updated since I worked on it in my repo.

### NPM:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@litelliott/lit-ceramic-integration

### Integration itself

First is the readme for overview, second is the documentation directory which was made by the code (as requested by the client):
https://github.com/itali43/lit-ceramic-integration/blob/docfix/README.md

https://github.com/itali43/lit-ceramic-integration/tree/docfix/documentation

### Example Project

Read the README for this one, not extensive, most was in the integration:
