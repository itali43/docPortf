# Portfolio of Documentation

Much of the documentation I've written over the years is still private, so I've gathered some here that I am permitted to share publicly.  

Folders denote projects or companies the work is for.  

Main objectives for documentation is clarity, completeness, and an opinionated direction, i.e. you'll know what you're doing and why you're doing it every step of the way in my documentation.
