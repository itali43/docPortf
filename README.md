# Portfolio of Documentation Samplings

###### ~~ Elliott Williams ~~

## What

Much of the documentation I've written over the years is still private, so I've gathered some here that I am permitted to share publicly.

## How

When I write them, my main objectives for docs are:

- clarity,
- completeness,
- and an opinionated direction,

i.e. you'll know what you're doing and why you're doing it every step of the way in my documentation.

## Clerical Notes

Folders denote projects or companies the work is for. Some things have been sanitized to enhance client privacy, but don't distract from the documentation overall. No private keys included tho, sorry.

Some files will reference code and scripts that I haven't included, for privacy of client or not thinking them important for the sampling. Request if you'd like, if it isn't privacy of client related I can add them.
