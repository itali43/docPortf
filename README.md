# Portfolio of Documentation

Much of the documentation I've written over the years is still private, so I've gathered some here that I am permitted to share publicly.

Folders denote projects or companies the work is for. Some things have been sanitized to enhance client privacy, but don't distract from the documentation overall. No private keys included tho, sorry.

Some files will reference code and scripts that I haven't included.

When I write them, my main objectives for docs are:

- clarity,
- completeness,
- and an opinionated direction,

i.e. you'll know what you're doing and why you're doing it every step of the way in my documentation.
